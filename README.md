# ctxpy
Library created to support the development of context-aware applications.
It is based on the concepts of http://contexttoolkit.sourceforge.net/

### toolkit
Currently supports Generators and Widgets (which can also aggregate data).
You don't have to worry about thread control or monitoring... and supports active and passive sensing.

### customs widgets and generators
You can also see a sample application that uses custom widgets and generators already implemented, with services such as GPS, Agenda etc.

### uncertainty measurer
It has a built-in measurer based in a proposed approach
by Clear and Dobson: "An approach to dealing with uncertainty in context-aware pervasive systems".

Feel free to contribute.
